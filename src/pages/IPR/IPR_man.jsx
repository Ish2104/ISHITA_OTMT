          IPR is like a shield for your brilliant ideas, inventions, and
          creations. It's a way to legally protect your work so others can't
          steal or copy it without permission. Just like how you lock your house
          to keep your stuff safe, IPR locks up your ideas so only you can use
          them.

            With IPR, you can let others use your ideas, but they have to pay
            you for it. It's like renting out your house – you earn money while
            still owning it.

            Knowing their ideas are safe, people are more likely to come up with
            new and cool stuff that can improve our lives.

            IPR can make your company more valuable. Investors like to see that
            your ideas are protected because it means they're investing in
            something secure.
